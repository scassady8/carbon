                        <h3>Patience is key!</h3>
                        <p>
                            Walking with a cat is not like walking with a dog. 
                            A walk with a cat will primarily be cat-led. 
                            They will likely stop often to smell things and explore the area. 
                            Be prepared to walk slowly and stand around as your cat explores. 
                            Even if you are out for a while, you may not walk that far, especially at the beginning. 
                            As your cat gains confidence, you will be able to walk further and expand the territory they feel comfortable with. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Be consistent</h3>
                        <p>
                            The more often you go out, the easier walking will become. 
                            At first, your cat may be hesitant to go outside or walk on the leash. 
                            Go slow and give them plenty of time to adjust to being outside. 
                            It's better to have short positive experiences at first to help your cat get used to walking and going outside.
                            As you continue to go out together, your cat will become more confident and relaxed, allowing for longer walks. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After your cat is used to going outside, you can work on teaching your cat commands.
                            Choose a word or phrase to consistently use for the behavior you want and then start by saying that word when your cat does the behavior. 
                            Eventually, your cat will be able to associate the word with the behavior you want and (hopefully) do the behavior you request.
                            But, being a cat, they may still choose to ignore you instead. 
                            The two phrases I find most helpful are "let's go" to start walking and "this way" for her to follow me a specific direction.

                        <h3>Ensure your cat's harness fits well</h3>
                        <p>
                            A harness is a must if you want to walk with your cat.
                            A collar is too easy for your cat to slip out of. 
                            Before taking your cat out for a walk, ensure the harness fits well and that your cat cannot slip out of. 
                            If you cat gets spooked by something, you don't want them to be able to slip out of their harness and take off. 
                            There are lots of varieties of harnesses available. 
                            You may need to try out a couple to find one that best suits your cat and that they tolerate.
                            Allow your cat to get used to the harness first inside so your cat isn't over-stimulated by the harness and being outside right away.
                            Once they are comfortable in the harness, you can start venturing outside with them.

                        <p>
                            Looks for paths and areas that are calm and relatively empty. 
                            Other people, especially if they are on bicycles or scooters, or dogs could scare your cat and make the walk less enjoyable for them. 
                            If a trail is popular, try to go early in the day before the trail gets crowded.

                        <p>
                            Does your cat like to find high surfaces in your house? 
                            Your cat may enjoy climbing trees.
                            Or perhaps your cat enjoys chasing birds and squirrels?
                            Find a place where they can run around and chase to their heart's content.
                            If your cat is food-motivated, bring treats on the walk and reward them periodically.
                            The more your cat enjoys the walk, the more likely they will want to go out again.

                            If you can, find paths where dogs are required to be on a leash.
                            That way, an owner should be nearby to handle their dog if you encounter them. 
                            Even if you are in an area where dogs need to be on a leash, a dog could get excited when they see your cat and try to slip their lead.
                            Remain aware of your surroundings and be prepared to pick your cat up if needed.

                            Walking is a great way for you cat to get out energy and get mental stimulation but they still lots of sleep to thrive.
                            Build up their stamina for long hikes slowly.
                            And, ensure your cat has plenty of time to rest and recover between walks.
